```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


After we conducted initial analysis on the dataset, the next step is to create a linear model on the first fires data. 

Recall earlier we have transform the raw datset to all numerical variables, and renamed it as `fires`.Now we plot a histogram to examine the response variable - **area** in the dataset.

```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
attach(forestfires)
hist(area, 40)

```
