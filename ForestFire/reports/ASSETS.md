###Asset List Requirement:

Document for yourself a list of assets (ASSETS.md) that specifies all assets that are needed. This should include

  * inputs: data and code (not documented elsewhere, you do not need to document intermediate code and data that fall into the ProjectTemplate or drake process flow, since we know how that works!)
  * outputs: plots, files, documents, produced by the analysis

The list of assets should not be onerous. It should contain a name, path to where the assets can be found, and a short description. This purpose of the assetlist two-fold:

1. It focuses you on what you need to produce. This is not necessarily always clear when you start and almost never clear for large projects that blend data from many different sources).

2. It documents (for future-you) where things are coming from you are producing and what is important.<br/><br/>
